## Learnings

in this project , I learned how to use the JPA more effectively.
I learned how to use a foreign key and relate multiple pieces of  
datas to the same  ID using  JPA's @ManyToOne annotation to establish 
relationships between multiple pieces of data for each ID.
I also learned how to test if the alternatives are true  by  using a 
Boolean column inside a  MySQL table, when 1 represents true and 0 represents false.
